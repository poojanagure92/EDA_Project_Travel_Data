Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step before you jump to machine learning or modeling your data. By doing this you can get to know whether the selected features are good enough to model, are all the features required, are there any correlations based on which we can either go back to the Data Preprocessing step or move on to modeling.
Once EDA is complete and insights are drawn, its feature can be used for supervised and unsupervised machine learning modeling.

What are the steps in EDA?

There are many steps for conducting Exploratory data analysis. below are the  few steps :
Description of data, 
Handling missing data,
